embolism, lost consciousness on the way to the Almonte General Hospital, 
went into cardiac arrest, and died from blood loss at around 7:15 P.M. A 
neighbour claimed that several residents were afraid of the Needhams' dogs 
to the point where they would not go near their residence, but another

pounds, was euthanized.[57][58][59][60][61]"

her to another dog, which was tethered. She was pronounced dead on arrival 
at a local hospital. The dogs had a history of killing rabbits, but her 
father did not believe they would harm the child. Blouin's father had

Cruelty to Animals and Blouin's father euthanized his several remaining 
dogs. He was breeding them for sale.[47][69][70][71]"

her home with 82 ""stab wounds."" Her mother, Louise Reynolds, was charged 
with second degree murder, accused of killing her child with scissors. 
There was dog excrement by the child, the dog was ""covered in ketchup,"" a 
witness stated there was blood on the bedding. No weapon was found and 
Louise claimed a Pitbull named ""Hat Trick,"" owned by an acquaintance, had 
killed her daughter. The dog was destroyed. A pathology report by Dr. 
Charles Randal Smith from Sick Kid's Hospital in Toronto claimed the child 
died from stab wounds, however he was not told there was a dog present. 
However, Dr. Rex Ferris of Vancouver, the pathologist who was involved in 
the famous ""dingo baby"" case in Australia in the 1980s, disagreed. Louise 
Reynolds spent three and a half years in jail awaiting trial, and during 
that time her other children were removed from her care. She was convicted, 
but exonerated in 2001. It was concluded that the pitbull killed Sharon.

tethered to several kennels on their property. He went outside alone and

around when his Rottweiler and a friend's Labrador attacked Sibthorpe. She 
was familiar with the Rottweiler, but the Labrador was new to her.

Hospital in Midland. Both dogs were euthanized. Sibthorpe's father turned 
himself in to police within a few days.[91][92][93][94][95]"
137,"Waddell, who had previously been in foster care for eighteen months, lived 
with his father and was under supervision from social workers at the time 
of the attack. He was hospitalized during the previous summer for a dog 
bite. Waddell's father and friends, who were all drinking, decided to do 
some electrical work in the basement. The only way to get into the basement 
was from outside. Mike Clark, who lived with the Waddells, decided to let 
his dogs out of their electrically fenced pen while on his way to the 
basement. Waddell decided to follow the men outside. He was left alone in 
the backyard, where Clark's dogs mauled him to death. Each dog weighed 
around 145 pounds and Waddell weighed 35 pounds. Clark's two unneutered 
dogs may have been excited by Waddell's dog, who was in heat and tethered 
on the porch. Waddell suffered bite marks all over his body, a broken back, 
a severed major artery, and had his throat torn out. His cause of death was 
blood loss. All four dogs were euthanized. Clark claimed that his dogs had 
no history of aggression.[96][97][98][99][100][101][102][103]"

and Anger's several older siblings. The children had previously been in 
foster care due to Fontaine's criminal activity and history of drug abuse. 
A social worker, who visited them four months prior, said ""the risk to the 
children had been substantially reduced."" Fontaine owned two dogs and was 
temporarily caring for Jenny Babee's two dogs. Babee described Fontaine's 
border collie as a ""crack dog"", since Harvey would allegedly put the dog in 
a box along with crack. Social workers did not believe the dogs were 
dangerous, but financially draining the family. Babee's dogs were kept 
outside or in the basement at night while she was away. They were 
barricaded in the kitchen on the night before Anger's death because another 
family friend was sleeping in the basement. It is possible that Babee's 
dogs jumped over the one metre plywood sheet keeping them in the kitchen. 
Anger was attacked by all four dogs while watching cartoons in the living 
room. He was found unresponsive by one of his siblings, whose yelling and 
screaming woke up their mother. Fontaine and Harvey took Anger to the Ridge 
Meadows Hospital before noon. He was not breathing, had fixed pupils, and 
no blood pressure nor pulse. Anger was pronounced dead at 12:12 P.M. He 
suffered injuries to his scalp, neck, extremities, and died from blood

148,"The infant was strapped in her car seat and placed on a kitchen chair while 
her 17-year-old mother and 37-year-old grandmother went outside to smoke. 
They left the door open and were less than three meters away. Police 
reported that the two were gone for at least twenty minutes, but a lawyer 
claimed they were gone for five minutes or shorter. Both of them went back

responders at around 3:30 P.M. The mother was charged with manslaughter

intimidating. Since this was the third dog mauling in Manitoba in eight 
weeks, the police stressed to the media that the man also suffered a 
cardiac arrest during the attack and that the public needed to wait for an 
autopsy report. However, there is no update as to the autopsy report by the 
police, nor any update to the investigation, so whether the man suffered

a dog, described as between 40 and 45 lbs, when the dog attacked him. 
Brgimantas fell to the ground and the dog attacked his chest and would not 
let go. A passerby heard screaming from Brigmantas and grabbed a baseball 
bat to attack the dog. When the dog was finally pulled off Brigmantas, he 
was deceased. It took 5 hours to seize the dog, and required it be pepper 
sprayed. A coroner's investigation determined that Brigmantas ultimately 
did not die of the dog's wounds, but by a medical emergency caused by the 
attack. However, the attack was part of the cause of death and the dog was 
euthanized.[142][143]"

Animal Services. The male dog that killed Milner was supposed to be wearing 
a muzzle, and was known by neighbours to be aggressive.[166] The man who 
struck the dog was not charged, as he did not have criminal intent and was

[197] While Bagaric removed one attacking dog, Smoki to his garage, his 
other two dogs, Bossi and Cinnamon, fatally mauled Williams. The incident 
was covered heavily in the media due to the fact that the owner, Bagaric, 
had a prior history of charges for possession of drugs,[196] and had lied 
that he had been the one to call 911 during the attack on Williams.[196] 
Bagaric had previously uploaded to social media a video of a Medicine Hat 
police officer euthanizing a fawn by stabbing it and slitting its throat.

causing community concern and an internal investigation, which led to a 
report that a communication breakdown had occurred.[198] Bagaric and his 
girlfriend, Taylin Calkins were jointly charged with 12 offenses under the 
Calgary Responsible Pet Bylaw.[196] Police claimed there was insufficient

an answer from Alberta Child Services why the child had died while in their
